## The polite development server

- serves as plain or pre-processed on-the-fly: coffee-script, less, sass/scss, stylus, markdown, jade, slim
- livereload
- multiple and aliased server roots
- path based proxy (useful to proxy to api server, or assets from live site)
- request logging (customizable, uses [morgan](npmjs.com/package/morgan))
- beautified pre-processed file output
- execute shell command on request
- save cache of requested files (useful for pre-processed output)
- CORS
- literate style coffee-script, js, jade, slim, stylus, etc... even md :-) all Ã  la coffee script litrate style (via [npm/illiterate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/illiterate))

## Examples

Assuming server runnung with something like... `sir .`

### Requesting a file:

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/Readme.md
    # Sir

    ## The polite development server
    ...

### Requesting a preprocessed version of a file:

Make the same request as if the file had already been compiled, and was being served, and it will be processed on-the-fly...

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/Readme.html
    <h1 id="sir">Sir</h1>
    <h2 id="the-polite-development-server">The polite development server</h2>
    ...

This also works for sass, coffeescript, jade, etc...

### Requesting the directory listing:

Add a `format` parameter to querystring, or add an `Accept` paramater header. Valid types are `json`, `text` and `html`.

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/?format=json
    ... or ...
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/ -H "Accept: application/json"
    [
      "bin",
      "History.md",
      "node_modules"
      ...
    ]

Ar for plain text list

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/?format=text
    ... or ...
    $ curl http://localhost:8080/ -H "Accept: text/plain"
    bin
    History.md
    node_modules
    ...

### Livereload

By default, livereload is enabled on the same port as the main server. This should work with the browser's livereload plugin, or adding the `/livereload.js?snipver=1` script to your html (which is served up by the sir). For convenience, adding `lr` to the querystring will inject `<script src="/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>` into your served file.

... without livereload ...

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/Readme.html
    <h1 id="sir">Sir</h1>
    <h2 id="the-polite-development-server">The polite development server</h2>

... with livereload ...

    $ curl http://localhost:8080/Readme.html?lr
    <script src="/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
    <h1 id="sir">Sir</h1>
    <h2 id="the-polite-development-server">The polite development server</h2>

If you don't want the livereload feature enabled at all, then there is a `--no-livereload` flag

### Multiple sources

You can serve up from multiple locations, for example:

    $ sir . vendor:~/lib/vendor

This will serve from the current directory, except requests for `/vendor/myfile.txt` will be served from `~/lib/vendor`.

You can also layer multiple sources into one directory...

    $ sir . vendor:~/lib/vendor:~/other/vendor

This will serve current directory, except paths starting `/vendor/` which will try to serve from `~/lib/vendor` and if the file is not found there, will be served from `~/other/vendor`, ultimately returning 404 if file is not found.

### Proxy

By default, requests to `/npm/<library>` are proxied to `https://unpkg.com/<library>` making it easy to load dependencies via the local server so for example `http://localhost:8080/npm/moment` will load moment js from npm-cdn. This can be switched off with the `no-npm` flag.

You can proxy requests based on url, for example...

    $ sir . github:https://api.github.com/repos/billymoon/sir

This will serve current directory, except for paths starting `/github/` which will be proxied to `https://api.github.com/repos/billymoon/sir` so that accessing...

    http://localhost:8080/github/issues?state=closed

... will proxy through the response from ...

    https://api.github.com/repos/billymoon/sir/issues?state=closed

### Cache

Useful for saving processed version of source files, for example, if you have `index.jade`, and `style.less` and want to save the html and css, add a `--cache backup` flag, and then visit `http://localhost:8080/index.html` in your browser. There should be a `index.html` and a `style.css` in the backup folder.

### Compress

Add gzip compression to served assets with the `--compress` flag.
